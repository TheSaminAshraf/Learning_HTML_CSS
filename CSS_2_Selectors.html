    Type

    Remember that declarations are a fundamental part of CSS because they apply a style to a
    selected element. Selectors help decide which elements get the style.
    A selector is used to target the specific HTML element(s) to be styled by the declaration.
    One selector you may already be familiar with is the type selector. Just like its name
    suggests, the type selector matches the type of the element in the HTML document.
    Some important notes on the type selector:
    1. The type selector does not include the angle brackets.
    2. Since element types are often referred to by their opening tag name, the type selector
    is sometimes referred to as the tag name or element selector.

    Universal

    The universal selector selects all elements of any type.
    Targeting all of the elements on the page has a few specific use cases, such as resetting
    default browser styling or selecting all children of a parent element.
    The universal selector uses the * character in the same place where you specified the
    type selector in a ruleset.

    Class

    CSS is not limited to selecting elements by their type. HTML elements can also have attributes.
    When working with HTML and CSS a class attribute is one of the most common ways to select
    an element.
    To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the
    class’s name.

    Multiple Classes

    We can use CSS to select an HTML element’s class attribute by name.
    It’s possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element’s class attribute.
    We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a
    space. This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without
    writing a custom class for every style combination needed.

    ID

    Oftentimes it’s important to select a single element with CSS to give it its own unique
    style. If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the
    id attribute.
    In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout
    an HTML document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.
    To select an element’s ID with CSS, we prepend the id name with a number sign (#).

    Attribute

    Attributes are added to add extra functionality or detail to the element.
    The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements that already contain attributes.
    Elements of the same type can be targeted differently by their attribute or attribute
    value. This alleviates the need to add new code, like the class or id attributes.
    Attributes can be selected similarly to types, classes, and IDs.
    The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square brackets.
    And it can get more granular from there by adding type and/or attribute values. One way
    is by using type[attribute*=value]. In short, this code selects an element where the
    attribute contains any instance of the specified value.

    Pseudo-class

    You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different
    state, after certain user interactions. For instance:
    1. When you click on an input element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in focus.
    2. When you click on a blue a link to visit to another page, but when you return the link’s
    text is purple.
    3. When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and disabled. But when
    all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s active.
    These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action. In fact, :focus, :visited,
    :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site
    navigation, and position in the document tree can all give elements a different
    state with pseudo-class.
    A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a
    colon : followed by a name.

    Classes and IDs

    CSS can select HTML elements by their type, class, and ID. CSS classes and IDs have different
    purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.
    CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements. By writing CSS classes, you can style
    elements in a variety of ways by mixing classes.
    While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element.
    IDs override the styles of types and classes. Since IDs override these styles, they should be
    used sparingly and only on elements that need to always appear the same.

    Specificity

    Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed.
    A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity so
    that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.
    IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, type.
    To make styles easy to edit, it’s best to style with a type selector, if possible. If not,
    add a class selector. If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector.

    Chaining

    When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS
    selectors at the same time.
    This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining.

    Descendant Combinator

    In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements
    that are nested within other HTML elements, also known as descendants.

    Chaining and Specificity

    Adding more than one tag, class, or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the
    CSS selector.

    Multiple Selectors

    In order to make CSS more concise, it’s possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors
    all at once. This prevents writing repetitive code.
    Instead of writing the same style code twice for two selectors, we can separate the selectors
    by a comma to apply the same style to both.

    Review

    What you learned:
    1. CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.
    2. All elements can be selected using the universal selector.
    3. An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.
    4. Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
    5. Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
    6. IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means
    IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles
    from a type selector.
    7. Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the
    specificity but can be necessary.
    8. Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
    9. Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector
    names with commas.
