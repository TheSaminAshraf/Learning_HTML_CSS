    Preparing for HTML

    HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers
    know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.
    This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML
    document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of
    HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the
    html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.
    In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is
    forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at the very beginning of
    your HTML documents.
    Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with .html extension.

    The <html></html> Tags

    To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing html tags after
    declaring <!DOCTYPE html>
    Anything between the opening <html> and the closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML
    code. Without these tags, it is possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML
    code.

    The Head

    We can give the browser some information about the page itself by adding a head element with
    the <head></head> tags. It goes above the body element.
    The head element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page
    that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the body tag,
    the metadata in the head is information about the page itself.

    Page Titles

    A browser's tab displays the title specified in the <title></title> tags. The <title></title>
    tags are always inside of the head element.

    Linking to Other Web Pages

    One of the powerful aspects of HTML, is the ability to link to other web pages.
    You can add links to a web pag by adding an anchor element using the <a></a> tags and
    including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.
    An anchor element is incomplete without the href attribute. This attribute stands for
    hypertext reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located
    (whether it is on your computer or another location). The paths provided to the href attribute
    are often URLs.
    When reading technical documentation, you may come across the term hyperlink. These terms are
    often used interchangeably.

    Opening Links in a New Window

    The target attribute of the anchor element specifies how a link should open.
    It’s possible that one or more links on your web page link to an entirely different website.
    In that case, you may want users to read the linked website, but hope that they return to
    your web page. This is exactly when the target attribute is useful.
    For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target
    attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href
    attribute.
    It’s likely that you are using a modern browser that opens up websites in new tabs, rather
    than new windows. Before the advent of browsers with tabs, additional browser windows had
    to be opened to view more websites. The target="_blank" attribute, when used in modern
    browsers, will open new websites in a new tab.

    Linking to Relative Page

    Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact.
    Before we learn how to link between internal pages, let’s establish where our files are stored.
    When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root
    directory, or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. As the size of
    the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder
    to organize your code.
    A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website,
    such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.google.com which
    is stored in a different folder). The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the
    file in the current folder.

    Linking At Will

    Text-only links, however, would significantly decrease your flexibility as a web developer.
    Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element
    with an anchor element. With this technique, it’s possible to turn images into links by
    simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a></a> element.

    Linking to Same Page

    When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page
    automatically scroll to a specific section.
    In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id attribute and a
    unique value.
    An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. The target
    link is a string containing the # character and the target's element's id.

    Whitespace

    As the code in an HTML file grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of how
    elements are related. Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements:
    whitespace and indentation.
    Both tools take advantage of the fact that hte position of elements in a browser is
    independent of the amount of whitespace or indentation in the html file.
    For example, if you wanted to increase the space between two paragraphs on your web page, you
    would not be able to accomplish this by adding space between the paragraph elements in the html
    file. The browser ignores whitespace in HTML files when it renders a web page, so it can be
    used as a tool to make code easier to read and follow.

    Indentation

    The second tool web developers use to make the structure of code easier to read is indentation.
    The spaces are inserted using the space and tab bars on the keyboard.
    The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is responsible for maintaining the style standards of
    HTML. At the time of writing, the W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation when writing HTML
    code. Although your code will work without exactly two spaces, this standard is followed by
    the majority of professional web developers. Indentation is used to easily visualize which 
    elements are nested within other elements.

    Comments

    HTML files also allow you to add comments to your code.
    Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->
    <!--Any characters in between will be ignored by
    your browser.
    Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:
    1. They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at
    a much later date.
    2. They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.

    HTML Tags Review

    1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
    This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
    2. The <html></html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
    3. Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head></head> of the
    page.
    4. You can add a title to your web page by using the <title></title> element, inside of the
    head.
    5. A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
    6. Anchor tags (<a></a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the
    same page.
    7. You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a></a> tags and adding ids to
    the elements you wish to jump to.
    8. Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how
    elements appear in the browser.
    9. Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships 
    visible.
    10. Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax:
    <!--comment-->
    <!--
