    Introduction to HTML Form Validation

    Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data.
    There are different types of validation. One type is server-side validation, this happens when
    data is sent to another machine (typically a server) for validation. An example of this type
    of validation is the usage of a login page. The form on the login page accepts username and
    password input, then sends the data to a server that checks that the pair matches up correctly.
    On the other hand, we use client-side validation if we want to check the data on the browser
    (the client). This validation occurs before data is sent to the server. Different browsers
    implement client-side validation differently, but it leads to the same outcome.
    Shared among the different browsers are the benefits of using HTML5’s built-in client-side
    validation. It saves us time from having to send information to the server and wait for the
    server to send back confirmation or rejection of the data. This can also help us protect our
    server from malicious code or data from a malicious user. It also allows us to quickly give
    feedback to users for specific fields rather than having them fill in a form again if the data
    they input into the form was rejected.

    Requiring an Input

    Sometimes we have fields in our forms which are not optional, i.e., there must be information
    provided before we can submit it. To enforce this rule, we can add the required attribute to
    an input element.
    The styling of the message ("Please fill out this field") varies from browser to browser.

    Set a Minimum and Maximum

    Another built-in validation we can use is to assign a minimum or maximum value for a number
    field, e.g. <input type="number"> and <input type="range">. To set a minimum acceptable value,
    we use the min attribute and assign a value. On the flip side, to set a maximum acceptable
    value, we assign the max attribute a value.

    Checking Text Length

    To set a minimum number of characters for a text field, we add the minlength attribute and a
    value to set a minimum value. Similarly, to set the maximum number of characters for a text
    field, we use the maxlength attribute and set a maximum value.

    Matching a Pattern

    In addition to checking the length of a text, we could also add a validation to check how the
    text was provided. For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the
    pattern attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. Regular expressions are a
    sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. If the input matches the regex, the form
    can be submitted.
    Let’s say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could
    use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they
    entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits.
    With the pattern in place, users can’t submit the form with a number that doesn’t follow
    the regex.

    Review

    1. Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
    2. Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field
    has information in it.
    3. Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable
    minimum value.
    4. Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable
    maximum value.
    5. Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an
    acceptable minimum number of characters.
    6. Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an
    acceptable maximum number of characters.
    7. Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
    8. If validations on a form do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the form
    cannot be submitted.
