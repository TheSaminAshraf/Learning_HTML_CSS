    Create a Table

    We can create a table by using the <table></table> tags.
    The table element will contain all of the tabular data we plan on displaying.

    Table Rows

    In many programs that use tables, the table is already predefined for you, meaning that it
    contains the rows, columns, and cells that will hold data. In HTML, all of these components
    must be created.
    The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element:
    <tr></tr>

    Table Data

    Rows are not sufficient to add data to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be
    defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: <td></td>.

    Table Headings

    Table data does not make much sense without title to describe what the data represents.
    To add title to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th></th>.
    The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant
    title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.
    The scope attribute can take on of two values:
    1. row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
    2. col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.

    Table Borders

    In older versions of HTML, a border could added to a table using the border attribute and
    setting it equal to an integer. This integer would represent the thickness of the border.
    The browser will likely still interpret your code correctly if you use the border attribute,
    but that doesn't mean the attribute should be used.
    We use CSS to add style to HTML documents, because it helps us to separate the structure of a
    page from how it looks.

    Spanning Columns

    Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The attribute accepts an integer (greater
    than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.

    Spanning Rows

    Data can also span multiple rows using the rowspan attribute.
    The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows. It accepts an integer (greater
    than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.

    Table Body

    Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: <tbody></tbody>
    The tbody element should contain all of the table's data, excluding the table headings.

    Table Head

    When a table's body is sectioned off, it also makes sense to section off the table's column
    headings using the <thead></thead> element.

    Table Footer

    The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the <tfoot></tfoot>.
    Footers are often used to contain sums, differences, and other data results.

    Styling with CSS

    Tables, by default are very bland. They have no borders, the font color is black, and the
    typeface is the same type used for other HTML elements.
    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content
    on a web page. You can use CSS to style tables.

    Review

    1. The <table></table> element creates a table.
    2. The <tr></tr> element adds rows to a table.
    3. To add data to a row, you can use the <td></td> element.
    4. Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th></th> element.
    5. Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
    6. Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
    7. Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
    8. A table's head is created with the <thead></thead> element.
    9. A table's body is created with the <tbody></tbody> element.
    10. A table's footer is created with the <tfoot></tfoot> element.
