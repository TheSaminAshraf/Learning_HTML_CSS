    Introduction to HTML Forms

    Just like a physical form, an HTML <form></form> element is responsible for collecting
    information to send somewhere else. Every time we browse the internet we come into
    contact with many forms and we might not even realize it. There’s a good chance that if you’re
    typing into a text field or providing an input, the field that you’re typing into is part of
    a <form></form>.

    How a Form Works

    Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate. The HTTP request instructs the
    receiving computer how to handle the incoming information.
    The <form></form> element is a great tool for collecting information, but then we need to send
    that information somewhere else for processing. We need to supply the form element with both
    the location of the where the form's information goes and what HTTP request to make.
    1. The action attribute of the form element determines where the information is sent.
    2. The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.
    Note: HTTP verbs like POST do not need to be capitalized for the request to work, but it's done
    so out of convention.
    The form element can also contain child elements. For instance, it would be helpful to provide
    a header so that users know what this form is about. We could also add a paragraph to provide
    even more detail.

    Text Input

    If we want to create an input field in our form, we will need the help of the input element.
    The input element has a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web page and what
    kind of data it can accept.
    The first value for the type attribute we are going to explore is "text". When we create an
    input element with type="text", it renders a text field that users can type into. Note that
    the default value of type is "text". It is also important that we include a name attribute for
    the input - without the name attribute, information in the input won't be sent when the form is
    submitted.
    After users type into the input element, the value of the value attribute becomes what is
    typed into the text field. The value of the value attribute is paired with the value of the
    name attribute and sent as text when the form is submitted.
    We could also assign a default value attribute so that users have a pre-filled text field
    when they first see the rendered form.

    Adding a Label

    For a user to properly identify an input we use the appropriately named label element.
    The label element has an opening and closing tag and displays text that is written between the
    opening and closing tags. To associate a label and an input, the input needs an id attribute.
    We then assign the for attribute of the label element with the value of the id attribute of
    input.
    Another benefit for using the label element is when this element is clicked, the corresponding
    input is highlighted/selected.

    Password Input

    We have the type="password" attribute for input.
    An input element with type="password" will replace input text with another character like an
    asterisk (*) or dot (.).
    Even though the password field obscures the text of the password, when the form is submitted,
    the value of the text is sent.

    Number Input

    If we want our users to type in a number, we can set the type attribute to "number".
    By setting type="number" for an input we can restrict what users type into the input field to
    just numbers (and a few special characters like -, +, and .). We can also provide a step
    attribute which creates arrows inside the input field to increase or decrease by the value of
    the step attribute. 

    Range Input

    Using an input element with attribute type="number" is great if we want to allow users to type
    in any number of their choosing. But, if we wanted to limit what numbers our users could type
    we might consider using a different type value. Another option we could use is setting type
    to "range" which creates a slider.
    To set the minimum and maximum values of the slider we assign values to the min and max
    attribute of the <input>. We could also control how smooth and fluid the slider works by
    assigning the step attribute a value. Smaller step values will make the slider move more
    fluidly, whereas larger step values will make the slider move more noticeably.

    Checkbox Input

    If we wanted to present multiple options to users and allowed them to select any number of
    options, we could use checkboxes. In a form, we would use the input element and set
    type="checkbox".
    1. There are assigned values to the value attribute of the checkboxes. These values are not
    visible on the form itself, that's why it is important that we use an associated label to
    identify the checkbox.
    2. Each input has the same value for the name attribute. Using the same name for each checkbox
    groups the inputs together. However, each input has a unique id to pair with a label.

    Radio Button Input

    Checkboxes work well if we want to present users with multiple options and let them choose
    one or more of the options. However, there are cases where we want to present multiple options
    and only allow for one selection like asking users if they agree or disagree with the terms
    and conditions.
    Radio buttons (like checkboxes) do not display their values. We have an associated label to
    represent the value of the radio button. To group radio buttons together, we assign them the
    same name and only one radio button from that group can be selected.

    Dropdown List

    Radio buttons are great if we want our users to pick one option out of a few visible options,
    but if we have a whole list of options, an alternative solution is to use a dropdown list to
    allow our users to choose one option from an organized list.
    We use the select element to create the dropdown list. To populate the dropdown list, we add
    multiple option elements, each with a value attribute. By default, only one of the options can
    be selected.
    The text rendered is the text included between the opening and closing option tags. However,
    it is the value of the value attribute that is used in form submission (notice the difference
    in the text and value capitalization). When the form is submitted, the information from this
    input field will be sent using the name of the select and the value of the chosen option.

    Datalist Input

    Even if we have an organized dropdown list, if the list has a lot of options, it could be
    tedious for users to scroll through the entire list to locate one option. That’s where using
    the datalist element comes in handy.
    The datalist is used with an input element with the attribute type="text". The input creates a
    text field that users can type into and filter options from the datalist.
    While select and datalist share some similarities, there are some major differences. In the
    associated input element, users can type in the input field to search for a particular option.
    If none of the options match, the user can still use what they typed in. When the form is
    submitted, the value of the input‘s name and the value of the option selected, or what the user
    typed in, is sent as a pair.

    Textarea Element

    An input element with type="text" creates a single row input field for users to type in
    information. However, there are cases where users need to write in more information, like a
    blog post. In such cases, instead of using an input, we could use textarea.
    The textarea element is used to create a bigger text field for users to write more text. We
    can add the attributes rows and cols to determine the amount of rows and columns for
    the textarea.
    When we submit the form, the value of textarea is the text written inside the box. If we want
    to add a default value to textarea we would include it within the opening and closing tags.

    Submit Form

    Remember, the purpose of a form is to collect information that will be submitted. That’s
    the role of the submit button — users click on it when they are finished with filling out
    information in the form and they’re ready to send it off.
    To make a submit button in a form, we’re going to use the reliable input element and
    set the type to "submit".
    Notice that the value assigned to the input shows up as text on the submit button. If there
    isn’t a value attribute, the default text, Submit shows up on the button.

    Review

    1. The purpose of a form is to allow users to input information and send it.
    2. The form's action attribute determines where the form's information goes.
    3. The form's method attribute determines how the information is send and processed.
    4. To add fields for users to input information we use the input element and set the type
    attribute to a field of our choosing:
        a. Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
        b. Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
        c. Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
        d. Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
        e. Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox that can be paired with other
        checkboxes.
        f. Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other
        radio buttons.
        g. Setting type to "text" and adding the list attribute will pair the input with a datalist
        element if the list of input and id of datalist are the same.
        h. Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.
    5. A select element is populated with option elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
    6. A datalist element is populated with option elements and works with an input to search
    through choices.
    7. A textarea element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
    8. When a form is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those
    fields are sent as name-value pairs.
    Using the form element in conjunction with the other elements listed above allows us to create
    sites that take into consideration the wants and needs of our users.
