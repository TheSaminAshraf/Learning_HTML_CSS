    Introduction to HTML Forms

    Just like a physical form, an HTML <form></form> element is responsible for collecting
    information to send somewhere else. Every time we browse the internet we come into
    contact with many forms and we might not even realize it. There’s a good chance that if you’re
    typing into a text field or providing an input, the field that you’re typing into is part of
    a <form></form>.

    How a Form Works

    Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate. The HTTP request instructs the
    receiving computer how to handle the incoming information.
    The <form></form> element is a great tool for collecting information, but then we need to send
    that information somewhere else for processing. We need to supply the form element with both
    the location of the where the form's information goes and what HTTP request to make.
    1. The action attribute of the form element determines where the information is sent.
    2. The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.
    Note: HTTP verbs like POST do not need to be capitalized for the request to work, but it's done
    so out of convention.
    The form element can also contain child elements. For instance, it would be helpful to provide
    a header so that users know what this form is about. We could also add a paragraph to provide
    even more detail.

    Text Input

    If we want to create an input field in our form, we will need the help of the input element.
    The input element has a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web page and what
    kind of data it can accept.
    The first value for the type attribute we are going to explore is "text". When we create an
    input element with type="text", it renders a text field that users can type into. Note that
    the default value of type is "text". It is also important that we include a name attribute for
    the input - without the name attribute, information in the input won't be sent when the form is
    submitted.
