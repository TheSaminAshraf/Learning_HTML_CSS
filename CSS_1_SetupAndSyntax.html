    Introduction to CSS

    While HTML is the fundamental structure of every web page, it can be visually unappealing on
    its own. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a language web developers use to style the HTML
    content on a web page.

    CSS Anatomy

    There are two methods or syntaxes for writing CSS code. One method is the inline style, and
    the other method is called the ruleset.
    Both syntaxes contain a declaration. Declarations are the core of CSS. They apply a style
    to the selected element.
    Understanding that a declaration is used to style a selected element is key to learning
    how to style HTML documents with CSS.
    Ruleset terms:
    1. Selector - The beginning of the ruleset used to target the element that will be styled.
    2. Declaration block - The code in-between (and including) the curly braces ({ }) that
    contains the CSS declaration(s).
    3. Declaration - The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to
    the selected element.
    4. Property - The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic
    of the element is to be modified.
    5. Value - The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property.
    Inline Style terms:
    1. Opening Tag - The start of an HTML element. This is the element that will be styled.
    2. Attribute - The style attribute is used to add CSS inline styles to an HTML element.
    3. Declaration - The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to
    the selected element.
    4. Property - The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual
    characteristic of the element is to be modified.
    5. Value - The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property.

    Inline Styles

    Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it’s possible to write CSS code
    directly within HTML code using inline styles.
    To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag.
    After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you’d like 
    applied to that element.
    If you’d like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the
    style attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;).
    It’s important to know that inline styles are a quick way of directly styling an HTML element,
    but are rarely used when creating websites. But you may encounter circumstances where inline
    styling is necessary, so understanding how it works, and recognizing it in HTML code is
    good knowledge to have.

    Internal Stylesheet

    HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with a style element nested
    inside of the head element. The CSS code inside the style element is often referred to as
    an internal stylesheet.
    An internal stylesheet has certain benefits and use cases over inlines styles, but once
    again, it’s not best practice. Understanding how to use internal stylesheets is nonetheless
    helpful knowledge to have.

    External Stylesheet

    Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML files
    contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).
    You can create an external stylesheet by using the .css file name extension,
    like so: style.css.
    With an external stylesheet, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without
    sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.

    Linking the CSS File

    When HTML and CSS codes are in separate files, the files must be linked. Otherwise, the HTML
    file won’t be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied.
    You can use the link element to link HTML and CSS files together. The link element must be
    placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires
    the following attributes:
    1. href - like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path,
    to the CSS file
    2. rel - this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file.
    Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
    Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.
    If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a
    relative path instead of a URL. Using a relative path is very common way of linking
    a stylesheet.

    an HTML file.
    6. Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.
