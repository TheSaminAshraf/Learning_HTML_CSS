    Introduction to HTML

    HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    1. A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw
    text.
    2. In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
    3. HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text
    through links, also known as hyperlinks.

    HTML Anatomy

    HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its contents.
    A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can
    use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

    A review of each part of an element:
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    1. HTML element (or simply, element) - a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML
    tags and the text or media it contains.
    2. HTML tag - the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle brackets.
    3. Opening tag - the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded
    by opening and closing angle brackets.
    4. Content - the information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing
    tags of an HTML element
    5. Closing tag - the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward
    slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

    The Body

    One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the body element. Only content inside
    the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen. Once the file has a body,
    many different types of content - including text, images, and buttons - can be added to the
    body.

    HTML Structure

    HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. When an element is contained
    inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said
    to be nested inside of the parent element.

    Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren,
    great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and
    descendant elements is known as hierarchy.

    Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and
    styling from their parent element.

    Headings

    Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. In HTML, there are six
    different headings, or heading elements. Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like
    titling sections, articles, or other forms of content.
    The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. THey are ordered from largest
    to smallest in size:
    1. <h1></h1> - used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
    2. <h2></h2>
    3. <h3></h3>
    4. <h4></h4>
    5. <h5></h5>
    6. <h6></h6>
    
    Divs

    One of the most popular elements in HTML is the div element. <div></div> is short for
    "division" or a container that divides the page into sections. THese sections are very
    useful for grouping elements in the HTML document together.
    divs don't inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to
    apply custom styles to our HTML elements. divs allow us to group HTML elements to apply the
    same styles for all HTML elements inside. We can also style the div element as a whole.
    divs can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember
    to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of divs for
    better readability.

    Attributes

    If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an attribute. Attributes are
    content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways,
    from providing information to changing styling. Attributes are made up of the following
    two parts:
    1. The name of the attribute
    2. The value of the attribute
    One commonly used attribute is the id. We can use the id attribute to specify different
    content (such as divs) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once.
    ids have several different purposes in HTML. When we add an id to a div, we place it in the
    opening tag.

    Displaying Text

    If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:
    1. Paragraphs (<p></p>) contain a block of plain text.
    2. <span></span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small
    pieces of content that are on the same line as other element.
    It's best to use <span></span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that
    is inline, or on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks,
    it's better to use a <div></div>.

    Styling Text

    You can also style text using HTML tags. The <em></em> tag emphasizes text, while the
    <strong></strong> tag highlights important text.
    Later, when you begin to style websites, you will decide how you want browsers to display
    content within <em></em> and <strong></strong> tags. Browsers, however, have built-in style
    sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:
    1. The <em></em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
    2. The <strong></strong> tag will generally render as bold emphasis.

    Line Breaks

    The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn’t affect the positioning of elements in the
    browser.If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML’s
    line break element: <br>.
    The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. You can use
    it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.

    Unordered Lists

    In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an
    easy-to-read list.
    In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul></ul>) to create a list of items in no
    particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.
    The <ul></ul> element should not hold raw text and won't automatically format raw text into an
    unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the
    <li></li> tags. The <li></li> is used to describe an item in a list.

    Ordered Lists

    Ordered lists (<ol></ol>) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered,
    They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first
    to last.
    You can create the ordered list with the <ol></ol> tag and then add individual list items using
    the <li></li> tags.


    Images

    The <img></img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both
    opening and closing tags, but the img tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of the img
    tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash - both will
    render properly.
    The img tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set to the image's
    source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of src must be the uniform
    resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file
    is stored.

    Image Alts

    The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites.
    The alt attribute can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute. The value of alt
    should be a description of the image.
    The alt attribute also serves the following purposes:
    1. If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended
    for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made possible by the
    description you provide in the alt attribute.
    2. Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When
    you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image’s description
    out loud to the visually impaired user.
    3. The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search
    engines cannot “see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive
    alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.
    If the image on the web page is not one that conveys any meaningful information to a user
    (visually impaired or otherwise), the alt attribute should be left empty.

    Videos

    In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> element, the
    <video></video> element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the
    <img> element however, the <video></video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.
    After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video
    displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video
    controls such as pausing and playing.
    The text between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is
    unable to load the video.

    Review

    1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of
    a webpage.
    2. Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between
    them.
    3. HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the
    enclosing parent element.
    4. Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.
    5. Headings and sub-headings, h1 to h6 tags, are used to provide titles for sections of
    content.
    6. p, span, and div tags specify text or blocks.
    7. The em and strong tags are used to emphasize text.
    8. Line breaks are created with the br tag.
    9. Ordered lists (ol) are numbered and unordered lists (ul) are bulleted.
    10. Images (img) and videos (video) can be added by linking to an existing source.
