    Introduction to Semantic HTML

    When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and Semantic HTML. The word
    semantic means “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the
    content between the opening and closing tags.
    By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements based on their meaning, not on how they are
    presented. Elements such as div and span are not semantic elements since they provide no
    context as to what is inside of those tags.
    For example, instead of using a div element to contain our header information, we could use a
    header element, which is used as a heading section. By using a header tag instead of a div,
    we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.
    Advantages of using semantic HTML:
    1. Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people
    with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret
    the code better.
    2. SEO: It improves the website SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of
    increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are
    better able to identify the content of your website and weight the most important
    content appropriately.
    3. Easy to understand: Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read
    for other web developers.

    Header and Nav

    A header element is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content
    containing h1 to h6 headings.
    By using a header tag, our code become easier to read. It is much easier to identify what is
    inside of the h1's parent tags, as opposed to a div tag which would provide no details as to
    what was inside of the tag.
    A nav is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It
    is important to note that nav can be used inside of the header element but can also be used
    on its own.
    By using nav as a way to label our navigation links, it will be easier for not only us, but
    also for web browsers and screen readers to read the code.

    Main and Footer

    Two more structural elements are main and footer. These elements along with nav and header help
    describe where an element is based on conventional web development standards.
    The element main is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is
    separate from the footer and the nav of a web page since these elements don't contain the
    principal content. By using main as opposed to a div element, screen readers and web browsers
    are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.
    The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the
    footer element. The footer contains information such as:
    1. Contact information
    2. Copyright information
    3. Terms of use
    4. Site map
    5. Reference to top of page links

    Article and Section

    section element defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area
    of the document with the same theme. A website's home page could be split into sections for the
    introduction, news items, and contact information.
    The article element holds content that makes sense on its own. article can hold content such as
    articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An article tag would help someone using a screen
    reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images,
    audio, etc.) begins and ends.

    The Aside Element

    The aside element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but
    isn’t required in order to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside
    other elements such as article or section. Some common uses of the aside element are for:
    1. Bibliographies
    2. Endnotes
    3. Comments
    4. Pull quotes
    5. Editorial sidebars
    6. Additional information

    Figure and Figcaption

    figure element is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration,
    diagram, code snippet, etc., which is referenced in the main flow of the document.
    figcaption is an element used to describe the media in the figure tag. Usually, figcaption will
    go inside figure. This is different than using a p element to describe the content; if we
    decide to change the location of figure, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure
    while a figcaption will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with
    a caption.
    While the content in figure is related to the main flow of the document, its position is
    independent. This means that you can remove it or move it somewhere else without affecting
    the flow of the document.

    Audio and Attributes

    The audio element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like video element, audio
    uses src to link the audio source.
    Although not always necessary, it’s recommended that we state the type of audio as it helps
    the browser identify it more easily and determine if that type of audio file is
    supported by the browser.
    Attributes provide additional information about an element.
    Attributes allow us to do many different things to our audio file. There are many attributes
    for audio. Some examples:
    1. controls: automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.
    2. src: specifies the URL of the audio file

    Video and Embed

    By using a video element, we can add videos to our website. The video element makes it clear
    that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.
    Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:
    1. controls: When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume
    control and a fullscreen option.
    2. autoplay: The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page
    is loaded.
    3. loop: This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.

    Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the embed tag, which
    can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gif from an external source.
    This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can
    be added to other websites. The embed tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the video element.
    Note that embed is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as video, audio and img,
    should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.

    Review:
    1. Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context
    as to what is in between the tags.
    2. Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen
    readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
    3. header, nav, main and footer elements create the basic structure of the webpage.
    4. section element defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other
    area of the document with the same theme.
    5. article element holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs,
    comments, etc.
    6. aside element contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in
    order to understand the dominant information.
    7. figure element encapsulates all types of media.
    8. figcaption is used to describe the media in figures.
    9. video, embed, and audio elements are used for media files.
